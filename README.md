# Cube-Chaos

A Game Project by me Wunarg

Currently the game is in a very messed up state so expect many bugs and problems as well as some potentially disastorous changes and much confiusion.


For starters go to SZENARIOS and click on TUTORIAL 1.
Then press space or shift to put the game on pause time.

(Enter will also open a menu to close the game and similar stuff)

The goal of the game is to kill the opponents Core which is the prominent cube on the right, 
while not letting your one (on the left) die.

To do this place Cubes from the right toolbar, on your side of the board, for a cost of mana.

For example try placing the rectangle which is supposed to look like its holding a sword.

For more information (like the health of cubes) hover over the cubes, this will also show what they.

Once you have completed the tutorial try playing the main game mode by hitting the play button in the main menu OR clicking opening the ENDLESS BATTLE szenario.

There i suggest the 
PRIEST CLASS
and 
DWARV RACE
as their cubes and abilitys are generally easy to understand.

In this game mode the ai will aktually try and place the random cubes it got in its hand and might kill you.
